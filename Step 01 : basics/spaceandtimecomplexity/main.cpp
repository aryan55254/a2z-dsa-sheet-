//what is time complexity
//time complexity != time taken as it depends on system and configuration
//the rate at which time taken increases with respect to input size it time complexity 
//big-oh notation = O(no of steps)
//always compare tc in terms of worst case scenario upper bond
//avoid constants 
//when input size if very large those constants have very less significance 
//avoid lower values which don't change significance as much 

//theta o average complexity 

//omega best case lowest bond 

//space complexity 
//its the memory space that your program takes 
//we will use big o notation as well 
//auxilliary space + input spcae 
//aux space is space that u take to solve the prolem
//input space soace u use to store the input
